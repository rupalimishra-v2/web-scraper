# Web Scraper

I understand web scraping as patience and attention to detail, it isn't rocket science. 
When I'm scraping, I usually spend 50% of my time parsing the source (traversing the HTML parse tree or inspecting 
an element to find the post form) and the other 50% ETL. 
The most useful tools for me are requests, bs4 and re.

This repository contains a couple of python web scrapers. 
These scrapers mainly target at different data collected from the nse india 
.

Scripts inside this repository are classified into two groups, 
beginner and advanced. At the beginning, the script is merely about some
technique to extract the data. 
As you progress, the script leans more towards data architect and other 
functions to improve the end product.
